# Unreal

Serves contents of JSON files.
 
Can be used to mock API response.

## Why?

I wanted to write some cool es6; and I needed a mock server that I could 
customize further when needed.

## Usage

* Clone the project.
* Put your mockup JSON file in a folder (F).
* Rename `config.example` as `config.json`.
* Update `DATA_PATH` on `config.json` to point to the JSON folder (F).
* Update the `urls` section of `config.json` to map to your **JSON** files.
* Run `node index-compiled`
* `http://localhost:8080` will be your mock server. For example visiting
`http://localhost:8080/api/bimbo` will output 
`{"lorem":{"some-other":"response"}}` which is the contents of `lorem.json`
which is mapped in `config.example` as `{"/api/bimbo": "lorem.json"}`

Thatâ€™s all for it now.

More features may come in the future.
